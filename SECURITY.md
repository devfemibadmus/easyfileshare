# Security Policy for EasyFileShare

## Introduction
I am committed to ensuring the security and privacy of users' data on EasyFileShare. This security policy outlines the measures and practices implemented to safeguard user information and maintain the integrity of the platform.

## 1. Secure File Transmission
I ensure that all files transmitted to and from EasyFileShare are encrypted using HTTPS protocol. This encryption helps protect user data during upload and download processes, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or interception.

## 2. Google Cloud Storage Security
I rely on Google Cloud Storage for storing user files securely. Google Cloud Storage implements industry-standard security measures to protect data at rest, including encryption and access controls. This ensures that users' files are protected against unauthorized access or tampering.

## 3. Limited Data Retention
To minimize the exposure of user data, EasyFileShare automatically deletes files after 3 days. This practice aligns with our commitment to data privacy and helps maintain a clean and clutter-free environment for users.

## 4. No User Accounts
EasyFileShare operates without the need for user accounts. By eliminating the requirement for user credentials, we mitigate the risk associated with managing user accounts, including password breaches and unauthorized access.

## 5. Regular Security Audits
I conduct regular security audits and assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the EasyFileShare platform. These audits help ensure that security measures are up-to-date and effective in protecting user data.

## 6. Compliance with Regulations
I am committed to complying with relevant data protection regulations and standards, including GDPR and CCPA. By adhering to these regulations, I strive to provide users with a secure and privacy-conscious file-sharing experience.

## 7. Security Awareness
I prioritize security awareness and education among team members involved in the development and maintenance of EasyFileShare. By promoting a culture of security awareness, we aim to prevent security incidents and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of user data.

## 8. Incident Response Plan
In the event of a security incident or data breach, I have an incident response plan in place to promptly detect, respond to, and mitigate the impact of the incident. This plan includes procedures for notifying affected users and relevant authorities as required by law.

## Conclusion
I am committed to upholding the highest standards of security and privacy on EasyFileShare. By implementing robust security measures and practices, I aim to provide users with a safe and secure platform for remote file sharing.
